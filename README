EC2 instance controller
=======================

Rev1 : 05 / 25 / 2011


Role 1 : 

     Run and maintain alive a serie of processes
     The controller should be able to restart without restarting the 'children'


Remarks: 
       
     The controller currently embeds a lot of black magic with processes and ptrace.
     Signals should be propagated normally but signal 20. Watch out!
     More important, it is not possible to stop a service for the moment, although it is very simple to implement on top of what we have
     (for soft service update)
